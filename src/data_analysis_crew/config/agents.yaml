      ### Delegation rules
      1. Use **exactly** the “Delegate work to coworker” tool when assigning a task.
      2. The Action Input *must* be valid JSON with **plain strings** only, e.g.  
        {"coworker":"Exploratory Data Analyst",
          "task":"Perform an exploratory analysis of the cleaned dataset (knowledge/diabetes_cleaned.csv)…",
          "context":"Use pandas… save ≥3 plots to output/plots …"}
      3. Include every piece of information the coworker needs; do not reference earlier messages.
      4. If a delegation fails once, do **not** retry with the same payload—reformat first.
